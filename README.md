line-array-modeling
===================

Acoustical line array modeling and comparison with alternative point sources.

This is a project created several years ago to aid in research work into line arrays and their use at St. Marks Cathedral, in Seattle Washington. The documentation and annotation is pretty sparse as I haven't had time to return to this project for the purpose of fixing up the code. I'll add a few comments for now and hope to find time to do more later.

###### This program was written for a particular purpose, however I did my best to make it a usable tool to learn how line arrays work. There are likely several optimizations that should be made, however at this point in time I am unable to make them.

Usage
---------
After evaluating (shift+enter in each block) the notebook a GUI you can work with will appear. Many of the options on the lower left are experimental (!!) and have not been fixed or do what you might think they do. 

1. Upon first viewing the program you should notice blue and red blobs. These appear this way due to the frequency being tested. I highly suggest testing it above 250Hz to see more tangible results. The calculation is a little muddy for frequencies. 
2. To update any changes of values on the page, please click one of the refresh 'buttons':

3. Steering Angles are in radians fun examples are π/20, π/17, π/14, 
4. The top part of the application has many extra options but they <i> should </i>  pretty self explanatory.  If not don’t hesitate to contact me at gavin.shirver@gmail.com

Questions & Comments
-------------
I am MORE than happy to help you decipher the code or what’s going on. I just don’t have the time to complete this read me right now, or take another pass at the code to improve it. Additionally, I have several variations of this file for anyone who may be interested. If you are interested in any of this or any of my research please don’t hesitate to contact me at [gavin.shriver@gmail.com](mailto:gavin.shriver@gmail.com) .
